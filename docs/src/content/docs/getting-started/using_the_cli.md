The Style Dictionary command line interface (CLI) provides an executable system to create and act upon style dictionaries.

## Installation

To use the CLI, you can install it globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g style-dictionary
```

Most of the time you will want to install Style Dictionary as a dev dependency in your NPM package. The reason to have it as a dev dependency rather than a regular dependency is that Style Dictionary is a build tool rather than a runtime tool because it is used to _generate_ files rather than used directly in an application.

```bash
npm install --save-dev style-dictionary
```

In your `package.json` file you can add an NPM script that runs Style Dictionary:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "style-dictionary build"
  }
}
```

## Commands

The CLI provides three basic commands:

- [build](#build) Builds a Style Dictionary package from the current directory.
- [clean](#clean) Removes files specified in the config of the Style Dictionary package of the current directory.
- [init](#init) Generates a starter Style Dictionary
- [version](#version) Get the version of Style Dictionary

These commands can be run using:

```bash
style-dictionary [command] [options]
```

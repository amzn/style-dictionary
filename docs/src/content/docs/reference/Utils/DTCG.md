These utilities have to do with the [Design Token Community Group Draft spec](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/).

For converting a ZIP or JSON tokens file to DTCG format, use the button below:

<sd-dtcg-convert></sd-dtcg-convert>

This button is a tiny Web Component using file input as a wrapper around the convert DTCG utils listed below.

## convertToDTCG

This function converts your dictionary object to DTCG formatted dictionary, meaning that your `value`, `type` and `description` properties are converted to be prefixed with `$`, and the `$type` property is moved from the token level to the topmost common ancestor token group.

```js
import { convertToDTCG } from 'style-dictionary/utils';

const outputDictionary = convertToDTCG(dictionary, { applyTypesToGroup: false });
```

`applyTypesToGroup` is `true` by default, but can be turned off by setting to `false`.

`dictionary` is the result of doing for example JSON.parse() on your tokens JSON string so it becomes a JavaScript object type.

:::danger
Do not use this hook with `applyTypesToGroup` set to `true` (default) inside of a Preprocessor hook!\
Style Dictionary relies on `typeDtcgDelegate` utility being ran right before user-defined preprocessors delegating all of the token group types to the token level,
because this makes it easier and more performant to grab the token type from the token itself, without needing to know about and traverse its ancestor tree to find it.\
`typeDtcgDelegate` is doing the opposite action of `convertToDTCG`, delegating the `$type` down rather than moving and condensing the `$type` up.

### convertJSONToDTCG

This function converts your JSON (either a JSON Blob or string that is an absolute filepath to your JSON file) to a JSON Blob which has been converted to DTCG format, see `convertToDTCG` function above.

```js
import { convertToDTCG } from 'style-dictionary/utils';

const outputBlob = convertJSONToDTCG(JSONBlobOrFilepath, { applyTypesToGroup: false });
```

`applyTypesToGroup` option can be passed, same as for `convertToDTCG` function.

Note that if you use a filepath instead of Blob as input, this filepath should preferably be an absolute path.
You can use a utility like [`node:path`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) or a browser-compatible copy like [`path-unified`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-unified)
to resolve path segments or relative paths to absolute ones.

### convertZIPToDTCG

This function converts your ZIP (either a ZIP Blob or string that is an absolute filepath to your ZIP file) to a ZIP Blob which has been converted to DTCG format, see `convertToDTCG` function above.

Basically the same as `convertJSONToDTCG` but for a ZIP file of JSON tokens.

```js
import { convertZIPToDTCG } from 'style-dictionary/utils';

const outputBlob = convertZIPToDTCG(ZIPBlobOrFilepath, { applyTypesToGroup: false });
```

## typeDtcgDelegate

This function processes your ["Design Token Community Group Draft spec"-compliant](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) dictionary of tokens, and ensures that `$type` inheritance is applied.

We built this utility because it's cheaper to apply the inheritance once, rather than on every access of a token's "$type" property, checking the ancestor tree to find it.

This utility is ran by default in Style-Dictionary after the parser hook and before the preprocessor hook.

```js
import { typeDtcgDelegate } from 'style-dictionary/utils';

const output = typeDtcgDelegate(input);
```

Input:

```js
{
  dimensions: {
    $type: 'dimension',
    sm: {
      $value: '5',
    },
    md: {
      $value: '10',
    },
    nested: {
      deep: {
        lg: {
          $value: '15',
        },
      },
    },
    nope: {
      $value: '20',
      $type: 'spacing',
    },
  },
}
```

Output:

```js
{
  dimensions: {
    $type: 'dimension',
    sm: {
      $value: '5',
      $type: 'dimension',
    },
    md: {
      $value: '10',
      $type: 'dimension',
    },
    nested: {
      deep: {
        lg: {
          $value: '15',
          $type: 'dimension',
        },
      },
    },
    nope: {
      $value: '20',
      $type: 'spacing',
    },
  },
}
```

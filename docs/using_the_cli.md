# Using the CLI

The Style Dictionary command line interface (CLI) provides an executable system to create and act upon style dictionaries.


# Installation
To use the CLI, you can install it globally via npm:
```bash
$ npm install -g style-dictionary
```


# CLI Quick Start
This will create a new folder called 'quick-start' and populate it with a Style Dictionary configuration and properties.
```bash
$ mkdir quick-start && cd quick-start
$ style-dictionary init basic
```
You can then modify the properties in the properties directory and run the build command below. See the changes in the output generated in the build folder.
```bash
$ style-dictionary build
```


# Commands
The CLI provides three basic commands:
* [build](using_the_cli.md?id=build)  Builds a style dictionary package from the current directory.
* [clean](using_the_cli.md?id=clean)  Removes files specified in the config of the style dictionary package of the current directory.
* [init](using_the_cli.md?id=init)      Generates a starter style dictionary

These commands can be run using:
```bash
$ style-dictionary [command] [options]
```

# Using the CLI

The Style Dictionary command line interface (CLI) provides an executable system to create and act upon style dictionaries.

# Installation

To use the CLI, you can install it globally via npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g style-dictionary
```

Most of the time you will want to install Style Dictionary as a dev dependency in your NPM package. The reason to have it as a dev dependency rather than a regular dependency is that Style Dictionary is a build tool rather than a runtime tool because it is used to _generate_ files rather than used directly in an application.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev style-dictionary
```

In your `package.json` file you can add an NPM script that runs Style Dictionary:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "style-dictionary build"
  }
```

# CLI Quick Start

This will create a new folder called 'quick-start' and populate it with a Style Dictionary configuration and tokens.

```bash
$ mkdir quick-start && cd quick-start
$ style-dictionary init basic
```

You can then modify the design tokens in the tokens directory and run the build command below. See the changes in the output generated in the build folder.

```bash
$ style-dictionary build
```

# Commands

The CLI provides three basic commands:

- [build](using_the_cli.md?id=build) Builds a style dictionary package from the current directory.
- [clean](using_the_cli.md?id=clean) Removes files specified in the config of the style dictionary package of the current directory.
- [init](using_the_cli.md?id=init) Generates a starter style dictionary

These commands can be run using:

```bash
$ style-dictionary [command] [options]
```

## build

Builds a style dictionary package from the current directory. Usage:

```bash
$ style-dictionary build [options]
```

Options:

| Name               | Usage                                | Description                                                                                           |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

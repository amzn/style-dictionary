Preprocessors are a new feature added to style-dictionary, which allows you to do any type of processing of the token dictionary **after** parsing, **before** resolving and transforming.
See [preprocessor docs](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/tree/v4/docs/preprocessors.md) for more information.

'style-dictionary': major
---

- The project has been fully converted to [ESM format](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), which is also the format that the browser uses.
  For users, this means you'll have to either use Style-Dictionary in ESM JavaScript code, or dynamically import it into your CommonJS code.
- `Style-Dictionary.extend()` method is now asynchronous, which means it returns `Promise<StyleDictionary.Core>` instead of `StyleDictionary.Core`.
- `allProperties` / `properties` was deprecated in v3, and is now removed from `StyleDictionary.Core`, use `allTokens` and `tokens` instead.
- Templates and the method `registerTemplate` were deprecated in v3, now removed. Use Formats instead.
- The package now uses [package entrypoints](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html), which means that what is importable from the package is locked down to just the specified entrypoints: `style-dictionary` & `style-dictionary/fs`. If more is needed, please raise an issue explaining which file you were importing and why you need it to be public API.

## Yaml Style Dictionary

This example shows how you can use yaml instead of JSON to store your style dictionary files. The magic happens in build.js where it replicates some of the functionality in style dictionary's `extend` method to use a yaml parser.

### Usage

1. `npm i` or `yarn i`
1. `npm start`

`⚠️ __integration__/build/variables.css
While building variables.css, token collisions were found; output may be unexpected.
Output name red was generated by:
color.red   #f00
color.background.red   #f00
This many-to-one issue is usually caused by some combination of:
* conflicting or similar paths/names in token definitions
* platform transforms/transformGroups affecting names, especially when removing specificity
* overly inclusive file filters`;
